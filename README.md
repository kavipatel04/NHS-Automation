Using Google Colab to parse google sheets data with Cloud SDK. 

<h2>Usage</h2>
This python program will run through each student name in a given google sheet. Then it will cross check that information with the list of people who attended (or completed their service hours). If their name is present in both sheets, it will give a completion mark in a designated column (potentially organized by time).
